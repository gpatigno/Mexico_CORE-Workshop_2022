Note that only the last qubit depends on the values of all the other input qubits and each further bit depends less and less on the input qubits. This becomes important in physical implementations of the QFT, where nearest-neighbor couplings are easier to achieve than distant couplings between qubits.\n",

It turns out that we can ignore rotations below a certain threshold and still get decent results, this is known as the approximate QFT. This is also important in physical implementations, as reducing the number of operations can greatly reduce decoherence and potential gate errors.  "
